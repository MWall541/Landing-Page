										<h2>Freelance Software<br />
										Development</h2>

									<!-- <a class="image fit"><img src="" alt="" /></a> -->
									<p>The beginnings of my journey. After finding that the developer of a beloved video game addon was struggling to keep consistency and quality in his own project, I channeled my love and sense of potential for the project, and took it upon myself to learn Java and contribute to the success of the project. To my first pull request to my last, I spearheaded the project to success by advancing in areas where my colleague could not, and kickstarted my career in software development. Today, I continue to freelance and commission my work out to many.</p>

									<p>The sole Java engineer behind the successful Minecraft addon "Wyrmroost." I was responsible for making the critical technical decisions and collaborated closely with a team of artists. Together, we brought mythological dragons to life, resulting in nearly 7 million downloads. With such high traffic, it was important to foster a community that expressed feedback and suggestions for me to incorporate into the projects success.</p>

									<p>With a staggering 16 million downloads, Dragon Mounts: Legacy is a company sponsored Minecraft addon written in java in which I had the privilege of redesigning from the ground up, challenging my technical skill and creative problem solving. The project is a revived 13+ year-old legacy Minecraft mod, beloved by millions. My work on the project involves intricate codebase adaptations to keep up with Minecraft's ever-evolving environment. Complex computations related to the physics and mathematics of flying creatures had to be tackled for a seamless experience for players. Beyond the technical aspects, fostering a vibrant community and actively listening to user feedback has been essential to the success and impact of the project's success and reach.</p>

									<p>As a Headstarter AI fellow, I am kickstarting my career as a software engineer by building 5+ AI apps and APIs using NextJS, OpenAI, Pinecone, StripeAPI, and more. I am also involved in developing projects from design to deployment leading 4+ engineering fellows using MVC design patterns. All the while being coached by Amazon, Bloomberg, and Capital One engineers on Agile, CI/CD, Git, and Microservice patterns. Finally, I'll take all I've learned and develop a large-scale PR to be accepted into an open source driven project.</p>
